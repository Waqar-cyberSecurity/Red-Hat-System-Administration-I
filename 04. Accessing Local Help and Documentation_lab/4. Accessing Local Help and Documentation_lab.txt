Lab 4: Accessing Local Help and Documentation
Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

Utilize local help resources to troubleshoot and learn Linux commands
Navigate manual pages (man) and info pages (info)
Use command-line help flags (--help)
Explore system documentation in /usr/share/doc
Employ whatis and apropos for command discovery
Examine package information using yum/dnf info commands
Prerequisites
A Linux system (RHEL, Fedora, or CentOS recommended)
Terminal access with standard user privileges
Basic familiarity with command-line operations
Podman installed (for container-related commands)
Lab Tasks
Task 1: Using Manual Pages (man)
Objective: Learn to access and navigate command documentation using man.

Open a terminal and type:

man ls
This displays the manual page for the ls command.
Navigate the man page:

Use Space to scroll down
Use b to scroll up
Use / to search (e.g., /color to find color options)
Press q to quit
Search for specific sections:

man 5 passwd
This shows the manual page for the /etc/passwd file format (section 5).
Expected Outcome: You can view and search through complete command documentation.

Troubleshooting Tip: If man isn't installed, run sudo dnf install man-db.

Task 2: Using Info Pages (info)
Objective: Access GNU-style documentation with info.

View info documentation:

info coreutils
This displays info pages for GNU core utilities.
Navigate using:

Enter to follow links
n (next), p (previous)
u (up one level)
q to quit
Expected Outcome: You can navigate hierarchical documentation for GNU utilities.

Task 3: Using --help Flag
Objective: Quickly access command syntax and options.

Try with common commands:

ls --help
podman --help
For detailed help:

podman run --help
Expected Outcome: Immediate access to command options without full manual pages.

Task 4: Exploring /usr/share/doc
Objective: Examine system-installed documentation.

List available documentation:

ls /usr/share/doc
View specific package documentation:

less /usr/share/doc/bash/README
Expected Outcome: Access to supplementary documentation files.

Task 5: Using whatis and apropos
Objective: Discover command purposes and find relevant commands.

Get brief command descriptions:

whatis ls
whatis podman
Find commands related to a topic:

apropos "list directory"
apropos container
Expected Outcome: Quickly identify command purposes and find tools by functionality.

Task 6: Examining Package Information
Objective: View package details using dnf/yum.

Check if Podman is installed:

dnf list installed podman
View package information:

dnf info podman
View changelog:

dnf changelog podman
Expected Outcome: Access to comprehensive package metadata and documentation.

Conclusion
In this lab, you've learned essential techniques for accessing Linux system documentation:

Used man and info for comprehensive command references
Employed --help for quick command syntax
Explored system documentation directories
Utilized whatis and apropos for command discovery
Examined package information with dnf
These skills will help you efficiently find information and troubleshoot without external resources.

Next Steps:

Practice these commands daily to build familiarity
Combine documentation lookups with grep for targeted searches
Explore man page sections (try man man for details)
Final Check: Verify your skills by:

Finding all commands related to "network"
Checking what the -a flag does for ls command
Viewing the Podman installation date on your system
