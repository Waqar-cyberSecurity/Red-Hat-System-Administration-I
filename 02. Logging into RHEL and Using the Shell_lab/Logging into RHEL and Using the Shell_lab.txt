Lab 2: Logging into RHEL and Using the Shell
Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

Log in to a RHEL system locally via the console
Log in to a RHEL system remotely using SSH
Execute basic shell commands (pwd, ls, man, exit)
Customize the shell prompt using the PS1 variable
Prerequisites
A RHEL 8 or RHEL 9 system (physical or virtual machine)
Network connectivity (for SSH)
A user account with standard privileges
For remote login: SSH server installed and running on the RHEL system
Lab Tasks
Task 1: Local Console Login
Objective: Access the RHEL system directly from the console.

Power on your RHEL system

If using a virtual machine, start it from your hypervisor.
If using physical hardware, power on the machine.
Wait for the login prompt

The system will display a login screen with a prompt like:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 (Plow)
Kernel 5.14.0-70.el9.x86_64 on an x86_64

localhost login: _
Enter your username and password

Type your username and press Enter.
When prompted, enter your password (no characters will be displayed as you type).
Verify successful login

After authentication, you should see a command prompt similar to:
[user@localhost ~]$
Troubleshooting Tip:

If login fails, verify caps lock is off and retype credentials carefully.
If you receive "Login incorrect", contact your system administrator to reset the password.
Task 2: Remote SSH Login
Objective: Access the RHEL system from another machine using SSH.

Verify SSH service is running on RHEL
On your RHEL system, run:

sudo systemctl status sshd
Expected output should show active (running).
Find your RHEL system's IP address
Run on RHEL:

ip a
Look for your active network interface (usually ens192 or eth0) and note the inet address.
Connect from a remote system
From your client machine (Linux/macOS/Windows with WSL), run:

ssh username@rhel-system-ip
Example:

ssh user@192.168.1.100
Authenticate and verify

Accept the host fingerprint if prompted (type yes).
Enter your password when requested.
You should now see the remote system's shell prompt.
Troubleshooting Tip:

If connection fails, check:
ping rhel-system-ip
If ping fails, verify network connectivity and firewall settings (sudo firewall-cmd --list-all).
Task 3: Basic Shell Commands
Objective: Learn fundamental shell navigation and help commands.

Subtask 3.1: Print Working Directory
pwd
Expected Output:
/home/username (or your current directory path)
Subtask 3.2: List Directory Contents
ls
Common options:
ls -l   # Long listing
ls -a   # Include hidden files
ls -lh  # Human-readable sizes
Subtask 3.3: Access Manual Pages
man ls
Navigate with arrow keys, press q to quit.
Search within man pages with /searchterm
Subtask 3.4: Exit the Shell
exit
For remote sessions, this will close the SSH connection.
For local sessions, this will log you out.
Task 4: Customize Shell Prompt (PS1)
Objective: Personalize your command prompt.

View current PS1 variable

echo $PS1
Typical default: [\u@\h \W]\$
Temporarily change prompt

PS1="[\u@\h \W \t]\$ "
This adds the current time to your prompt.
Make changes permanent
Edit ~/.bashrc:

nano ~/.bashrc
Add at the end:

export PS1="[\u@\h \W \t]\$ "
Save (Ctrl+O), exit (Ctrl+X), then reload:
source ~/.bashrc
Common PS1 Symbols:

\u: Username
\h: Hostname
\W: Current directory
\t: Time
Conclusion
In this lab, you have:

Successfully logged into a RHEL system both locally and remotely via SSH
Practiced essential shell commands for navigation and documentation
Customized your shell prompt for better usability
These fundamental skills form the basis for all command-line operations in RHEL and are essential for working with container technologies like Podman in OpenShift environments.

Next Steps
Practice these commands regularly to build muscle memory
Explore additional shell commands (cd, cat, grep)
Learn about shell scripting basics for automation
