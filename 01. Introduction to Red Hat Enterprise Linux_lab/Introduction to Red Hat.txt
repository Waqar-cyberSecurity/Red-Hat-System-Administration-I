*Lab 1: Introduction to Red Hat Enterprise Linux**

## **Objectives**
By the end of this lab, you will:  
- Understand the fundamentals of open-source software.  
- Learn about Linux distributions and their significance.  
- Explore Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) characteristics and its subscription model.  

## **Prerequisites**  
- A system with internet access.  
- A terminal or command-line interface (CLI).  
- Basic familiarity with command-line operations.

## **Task 1: Understanding Open Source and Linux**  

### **Subtask 1.1: Define Open Source**  
**Objective**: Learn what open-source software is and its key principles.  

1. Open your terminal.  
2. Run the following command to fetch the Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition:  
   ```bash
   curl -s https://opensource.org/osd | grep -A5 "Open Source Definition"
Expected Output:
Displays the Open Source Definition summary.

Key Concepts:
Free Redistribution: No restrictions on selling or giving away software.
Source Code Availability: Must include source code.
Derived Works: Modifications and derived works must be allowed.
Troubleshooting:

If curl is not installed, install it using:
sudo dnf install curl -y  # For RHEL-based systems
Subtask 1.2: Introduction to Linux
Objective: Understand Linux as an open-source operating system.

Check the kernel version (core of Linux) using:

uname -r
Expected Output:
Displays the Linux kernel version (e.g., 5.14.0-70.el9.x86_64).

Key Concepts:

Kernel: Manages hardware resources.
GNU Tools: Provides essential utilities (ls, grep, bash).
Task 2: Exploring Linux Distributions
Subtask 2.1: List Popular Linux Distributions
Objective: Identify major Linux distributions and their use cases.

Research common distributions:

Debian: Community-driven, stable.
Ubuntu: User-friendly, based on Debian.
RHEL: Enterprise-focused, subscription-based.
Check your distribution (if using Linux):

cat /etc/os-release
Expected Output:
Displays OS name, version, and ID (e.g., RHEL 9.0).

Subtask 2.2: Compare Distributions
Objective: Understand differences between RHEL and others.

Feature	RHEL	Ubuntu
Support	Paid	Community/Paid
Package Manager	dnf	apt
Release Cycle	5-10 years	6 months LTS
Task 3: RHEL Characteristics and Subscription
Subtask 3.1: RHEL Features
Objective: Learn key RHEL features.

Security: SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is default.

sestatus
Expected Output:
Shows SELinux status (e.g., enforcing).

Stability: Long-term support (10+ years).

Subtask 3.2: RHEL Subscription Model
Objective: Understand how RHEL subscriptions work.

Register a system (requires Red Hat account):
sudo subscription-manager register --username <your_username> --password <your_password>
Attach a subscription:
sudo subscription-manager attach --auto
Verify:
sudo subscription-manager list --consumed
Expected Output:
Lists active subscriptions.
Troubleshooting:

If subscription-manager is missing, install it:
sudo dnf install subscription-manager -y
Conclusion
In this lab, you:

Defined open-source principles and Linux.
Explored major Linux distributions and compared them.
Learned RHELâ€™s security features and subscription model.
Next Steps:

Practice commands on a live RHEL system.
